1. Culmination of technologies mastered in last 6 months
 * HTML5
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * AngularJS

### Technologies Used:
> 1. HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
> 2. [jQuery 2.2.4](https://jquery.com/): DOM Manipulation
> 3. [jQuery-UI 1.11.4](https://angularjs.org/): DOM Element Translation
> 4. [Angular 1.5.6](https://angularjs.org/): Core app functionality
> 5. [Angular Route 1.5.6](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute): App navigation
> 6. [Angular Material 1.0.9](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/): Styling for AngularJS Apps
> 7. [ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/): Displaying of Ledger Data
> 8. [Local File Read](http://jsfiddle.net/alexsuch/6aG4x/535/): For reading the local saves
> 9. [Draggable Elements](https://siongui.github.io/2013/04/04/angularjs-draggable-movable-element/): Element Movement on Checks
> 10. [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library](https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/): For local file save encryption/decryption 

### Final Result:
##### Off-Line, Front-End App for tracking account information and printing checks
> The user must first create a new bank account in order to access the majority of features of the application. No login is required as none of the user's information is stored online in an encrypted txt file using the sjcl encyption library.
 
> Once an account is created, a user can add/remove transactions from the bank ledger and select items to send to the check printer portion of the application.

> Again, the application allows the user to locally save their data in an encrypted text file.


### How to run:
```
1. Go to: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server` and install "http-server".
